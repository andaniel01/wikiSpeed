# Wiki-Speed-Solver

Wiki-Speed-Solver is inspired by an online game "Wiki Game" (https://www.thewikigame.com/group), where one has to find a path from one word to another traversing links within a Wikipedia page. This code generates the shortest path from one key word the another using the Breadth First Search and uses the BeautifulSoup to scrape the data on the wikipedia page.
